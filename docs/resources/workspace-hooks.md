## Schema

### Required
- `workspace` (String) Path parameter.

### Optional
- `uid` (String) Path parameter (auto-populated from API response).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource identifier (extracted from API response).
- `api_response` (String) The raw JSON response from the Bitbucket API.
- `active` (String) active
- `created_at` (String) created_at
- `description` (String) A user-defined description of the webhook.
- `events` (List of String) The events this webhook is subscribed to. [issue:comment_created, issue:created, issue:updated, pipeline:span_created, project:updated, pullrequest:approved, pullrequest:changes_request_created, pullrequest:changes_request_removed, pullrequest:comment_created, pullrequest:comment_deleted, pullrequest:comment_reopened, pullrequest:comment_resolved, pullrequest:comment_updated, pullrequest:created, pullrequest:fulfilled, pullrequest:push, pullrequest:rejected, pullrequest:unapproved, pullrequest:updated, repo:commit_comment_created, repo:commit_status_created, repo:commit_status_updated, repo:created, repo:deleted, repo:fork, repo:imported, repo:push, repo:transfer, repo:updated]
- `secret` (String) The secret to associate with the hook. The secret is never returned via the API. As such, this field is only used during updates. The secret can be set to `null` or "" to remove the secret (or create a hook with no secret). Leaving out the secret field during updates will leave the secret unchanged. Leaving out the secret during creation will create a hook with no secret.
- `secret_set` (String) Indicates whether or not the hook has an associated secret. It is not possible to see the hook's secret. This field is ignored during updates.
- `subject` (Object) Base type for most resource objects. It defines the common `type` element that identifies an object's type. It also identifies the element as Swagger's `discriminator`.
  Nested schema:
  - `type` (String) type

- `subject_type` (String) The type of entity. Set to either `repository` or `workspace` based on where the subscription is defined. [repository, workspace]
- `url` (String) The URL events get delivered to.
- `uuid` (String) The webhook's id
